OS specific
    UNIX
        Root directory:  “ / “ 
        Directory separator: “ / “

    WINDOWS
        Root directory: “  <partition letter> : \ “
        Directory separator: “ / “ or “ \ ”

        Note that windows allows filenames to be followed by extra . \ / characters.

In many operating systems, null bytes %00 can be injected to terminate the filename. For example, sending a parameter like:

    ?file=secret.doc%00.pdf

    will result in the Java application seeing a string that ends with “.pdf” and the operating system will see a file that ends in “.doc”.
    Attackers may use this trick to bypass validation routines.
